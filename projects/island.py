#Write a function that takes a 2D binary array and returns the number of 1 islands. An island consists of 1s that are connected to the north, south, east or west. #For example:islands = [[0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
#           [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
#          [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
#          [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
#          [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]]
#island_counter(islands) # returns 4

def island_counter(self, islands):
    

# connected - has edges, connected components
# array/2d - graph
# n, s, w, e -edges
# binary - values
# island/1 islands - connected components
